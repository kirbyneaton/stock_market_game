This game lets the player (not) put thier money where their mouth is and see how their money would've grown if they had gotten into/out of the market at the specified times. The rules are easy--just buy and sell whenever you feel the market is ripe and see how your skills compare to a simple buy and hold approach. Did you beat the market?",
